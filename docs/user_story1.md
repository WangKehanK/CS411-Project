# Login

As a new (google) user, I want to login to this application with a third party account (my Google account) so that I don’t have to make a new account.

- Trigger: The new user clicks on the “Login with Google” button
- Pre-conditions:
  
The user has a Google account

- Description: The user will hit the login button in the top-right corner which will redirect you to a login page where you can login through google. The user will enter his username and password; if the user types it correctly, the user will be logged in and redirected to the main page; if not, the system will print an error message to say “username or password doesn’t match”. In such a case, the user will be able to select “forget password” to reset their password; For first time users, it will have a “signup” button; For “Google” users, it will have a “login as google” button.
