## Express (Node.js)
ExpressJS is a prebuilt NodeJS framework that can help you in creating server-side web applications faster and smarter. Simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, scalability are some of its characteristics. 


## Django

Django is an MVT web framework used to build web applications. It defines itself as a “batteries included” web framework, with robustness and simplicity to help web developers write clean, efficient and powerful code. It is among the most famous web frameworks out there in the world and it’s one of the most used frameworks as well. It’s used by Instagram, Youtube, Google and even NASA for their website. In our selection process, we evaluated the pros and cons of implementing web applications with Django as shown below:

Advantages- 

a. The biggest advantage about Django is that it is battery included. This means that it comes with many packages, so as devs we could just simply import some packages instead of writing them in our application.	

b. Django is written in the Python language; this means it is using the easiest programming language. 

Disadvantages-

a. Template errors fail silently by default, so we might waste a lot of time trying to figure out what’s wrong with the application, or not even know that our application has a problem.

b. The URL specifying regular expressions is not an easy task to accomplish.

## Why we chose NodeJS

In our case, we don’t need to implement plenty of APIs, so using ExpressJS can help us organize all the files, the code is easier to read and implement. NodeJS is not as useful for intense applications, but our crypto web application would not require such performance anyways. Using ExpressJS also allows us to have a simpler development environment because of its consistency of languages. The most important —— we are more familiar with javascript :)
