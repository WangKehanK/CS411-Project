# Favorite 

As a user, after login, I need to save the desired cryptocurrency into my <favorite> list so that I can access related information very easily in the future.

- Trigger: The user clicks the “Favorite” button on the top of the page
- Pre-conditions:

The user is logged in (see #Login story for details)

- Description: After login, the top-right corner will be replaced with a “favorite” button. The user can click the button, and it will redirect him to the favorite page where it will show all of their favorite cryptocurrencies. The user can modify the list by pressing the “add” or “delete” button on the top of the page. If there are not yet any favorited cryptocurrencies then the page will show an error statement alerting the user as such. As part of the #Search story, the user should also be able to see a “Favorite” button next to each of their search results which will allow them to quickly add a cryptocurrency to their favorites page.
