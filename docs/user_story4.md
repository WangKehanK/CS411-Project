# Visualizations and News

As a logged-in user who has already favorited certain cryptocurrencies I need to be able to easily and visually see how those currencies are performing so that I don’t have to manually search for information. 

- Trigger: The user accesses the main page
- Pre-conditions:

The user is logged in (see #Login story for details)

The user has one or more items in their “Favorite” list (see #Favorite story for details)

- Description: On the user’s main page they should be able to see their favorited cryptocurrencies. After clicking on one of them they will be directed to a page that shows a graph of that currency’s price over time, popularity, and other relevant values. Next to the graph a section of the most recent/popular news regarding that currency will be displayed, with links to the articles available to click on. Below that, news about major crypto mining/trading firms related to that currency will be shown with similar links. If the user does not have any favorited currencies then their main page will promote the search option as well as display basic graphs about the top 5 cryptocurrencies, as well as general recent cryptocurrency news.
